## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then run `bin/server` to fire up the development server, or run `rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

To deploy the builded style guide to GitHub Pages, simply run `bundle exec rake deploy` and the source will be builded and pushed to `gh-pages` of the origin repo.
